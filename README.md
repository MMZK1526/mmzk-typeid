# mmzk-typeid

A [typeid](https://github.com/jetpack-io/typeid) implementation in Haskell.

# Usage
TODO; for now please see the [Main](src/Main.hs) file which contains some very simple usages.

# Note
Not explicitly exported functions are considered internal and are subjected to changes.
The [Main](src/Main.hs) file serves as a temporary playground and its contents are ephemeral.

# Next up
- [x] Unit tests
- [x] Type-level typeid prefixes
- [ ] Publish a package
